# OMR-based-Sentiment-Insights

ABSTRACTION
This study introduces an advanced Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) system integrated with sentiment analysis to enhance data interpretation across various domains. Unlike traditional OMR, which only captures filled responses, the proposed system detects emotional markers such as stress, confidence, and confusion, offering deeper cognitive and psychological insights. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytic, this framework automates sentiment assessment, improves accuracy, and streamlines large- scale data processing.
The system is particularly beneficial in education, where it helps evaluate student performance and emotional states, and in business sectors, where it enhances survey reliability and market research. The technical feasibility is ensured through high- resolution scanning, AI-driven classification, and statistical validation, demonstrating its efficiency in handling large datasets with high accuracy. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness in extracting sentiment-based insights, making it a versatile tool for public opinion polling, institutional feedback, and policy evaluation.
Future enhancements will focus on real-time emotion tracking and expanding its applicability to diverse assessment environments, further optimizing decision-making and personalized feedback mechanisms.
